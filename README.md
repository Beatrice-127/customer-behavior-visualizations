# Customer Engagement Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

This project analyzes **real anonymized data** from an online learning platform, provided through a SQL and Tableau course on Udemy. The dataset contains records for **19,332 users** across a **10-month period** (January to October 2022), capturing behavior such as registration, **66,460 video watch logs**, subscription activity, over **15,000 exam attempts**, and more than **4,000 certificates issued**.

Through a series of structured SQL queries, I transformed raw platform data into analysis-ready tables, covering different stages of the student lifecycle. These were visualized in Tableau Public using a set of interactive dashboards focused on engagement, onboarding, conversion, course performance, and career track progress.

Dashboard from this project are published on Tableau Public:

## SQL Usage in This Project

SQL was the foundation of this project. I used it not only to extract and join data across multiple relational tables, but also to implement business logic directly through `CASE` statements, aggregations, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

The queries were designed with scalability and readability in mind, making use of layered transformations to build clear, modular logic. I also created intermediate and final output tables using `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` to support Tableau dashboards. These SQL workflows simulate a simplified data pipeline and demonstrate how analytical reporting can be structured entirely within SQL.



## Tableau Visualizations

### 1. Overview Dashboard

![01_overview](./screenshots/01_overview.png)

This dashboard provides a high-level summary of student engagement and course performance on the platform. It includes:

- **Key Metrics**: Number of engaged students, average minutes per student, and total certificates issued
- **Course Metrics Selector**: A dynamic bar chart that shows either:
  - Overall minutes watched
  - Minutes per student
  - Completion rate  
  for the top or bottom 5 courses, depending on user selection
- **Course Rating Breakdown**: A donut chart displaying the distribution of course ratings along with the average rating

### 2. Engagement and Onboarding Dashboard

![02_engagement_date](./screenshots/02_engagement_date.png)

This dashboard shows platform activity and onboarding success over a user-selected time period. It includes:

- **Daily Engagement**: Line chart tracking the number of engaged students per day  

- **Daily Onboarding Rate**: Line chart showing the percentage of newly registered users who became onboarded on each date

  > **Onboarding Definition**:  
  > A student is considered onboarded if they have done at least one of the following:  
  >
  > - Watched a video  
  > - Solved a quiz  
  > - Attempted an exam

Users can filter by subscription type (All, Free, Paid) and select a custom date range.

#### Monthly Detail View

![02_engagement_month](./screenshots/02_engagement_month.png)

To explore trends in more detail, users can select a specific month to see day-by-day engagement and onboarding rates. This helps identify spikes or dips in platform activity across different periods.

#### Yearly Summary View

![02_engagement_year](./screenshots/02_engagement_year.png)

This view summarizes student engagement and onboarding rates across all months in the dataset. Although the current dataset covers only one year, the dashboard is structured to support multi-year comparisons in the future.

- **Monthly Engagement**: Bar chart showing the total number of engaged students per month
- **Monthly Onboarding Rate**: Bar chart showing the average onboarding rate for students registered in each month

### 3. Cohort Engagement Dashboard

![03_cohort](./screenshots/03_cohort.png)

This dashboard presents a cohort analysis of student engagement over time. It consists of:

- **Retention Curve**: A line chart showing the percentage of active users in each monthly cohort across 10 periods (weeks or months depending on context)
- **Cohort Table**: A heatmap-like table showing the number of active users per cohort per period. The color scale reflects relative engagement intensity

Users can filter the chart by:
- **Subscription Type**: All, Free, or Paid
- **Cohort Month**: To focus on specific user entry periods

A hover tooltip (lightbulb icon) provides guidance on how to interpret and use the cohort chart effectively.

### 4. Exams and Certificates Dashboard

#### Certificate Issuance View

![04_exam_and_certificates](./screenshots/04_exam_and_certificates.png)

This dashboard analyzes exam activity and certificate issuance over time.

- **Left Chart â€“ Monthly Exam Breakdown**: Stacked bar chart showing the number of passed vs. failed exams per month. Users can filter by exam category (Practice, Course, Career Track)
- **Right Chart â€“ Certificate Issuance**: Bar chart showing the number of certificates issued per month. Certificate type (Course or Career Track) can be selected via filter

#### Career Track Funnel View

![04_exam_and_funnel](./screenshots/04_exam_and_funnel.png)

This alternate view retains the same monthly exam breakdown on the left and replaces the right panel with:

- **Career Track Funnel**: Horizontal bar chart showing the number of students progressing through key actions in a career track:
  - Enrolled in a track
  - Attempted a course exam
  - Completed a course exam
  - Attempted a final exam
  - Earned a career track certificate

### 5. Learning and F2P Dashboard

#### F2P Conversion View

![05_learning_f2p](./screenshots/05_learning_f2p.png)

This dashboard explores how much students watch and how that relates to conversion behavior.

- **Left Chart â€“ Monthly Viewing Trends**: A combo chart showing total minutes watched (bar) and average minutes per student (line) by month
- **Right Chart â€“ F2P Conversion by Engagement Bucket**: Each bar represents the number of students in a given watch-time range; the line shows the percentage of students in each bucket who converted from free to paid

#### Paid Duration View

![05_learning_paid](./screenshots/05_learning_paid.png)

The left chart remains the same, while the right chart shows:

- **Paid Days by Watch-Time Bucket**: Each bar represents the number of students within a given total watch-time range; the line shows the average number of paid subscription days per group
