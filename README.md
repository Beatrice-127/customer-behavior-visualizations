# 📊 Customer Engagement Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

This project is part of a simulated data analyst experience. It showcases how to extract, transform, and prepare SQL data for business analysis and visualization in Tableau. The analysis covers customer learning behavior, subscriptions, exams, and course performance.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Understand user engagement on a learning platform
- Identify free-to-paid conversion patterns
- Analyze course-level performance and certificate outcomes
- Build Tableau dashboards based on SQL-derived tables

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Structure
The data is stored in a SQL database and includes:
- `student_info`, `student_learning`, `student_purchases`
- `student_exams`, `exam_info`, `student_certificates`
- `course_info`, `course_ratings`, `career_track_info`

All queries use a preprocessed subscription view: `purchases_info`.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL flavor)
- Tableau Public (for visualizations)

Since Tableau Public does not support direct SQL database connections, all visualizations are built using `.csv` exports generated by the script below:

> [`10_create_tableau_outputs.sql`](./10_create_tableau_outputs.sql)

If you're using Tableau Desktop (licensed version), you can skip this step and connect directly to your database using the raw queries in `01_...sql` to `09_...sql`.

## 📈 Tableau Visualizations
Here are a few example charts built from the output tables:
- F2P Conversion Funnel (based on `student_buckets_f2p`)
- Certificate vs. Paid Status (based on `student_certificates`)
- Course Rating Distribution (based on `course_ratings_summary`)
- Engagement Buckets by Subscription Length

## 🧾 Notes
- This project is based on a simulated learning dataset.
- All queries and analysis are original and written by me.
- No proprietary data from Udemy or Forage is included.
